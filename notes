- Modify sim hash such that it works on only the frequent words

MD5 faster than SHA hashing

SIMHASH is TF, try incorporating IDF

Implement tf idf


test simhash when doing artificial modifications from 0-35%
	- resulte din 0.8 accuracy

test tf-idf when doing artificial modifications from 0-35%
	- resulted in 0.87 accuracy	

python tester.py ../data/en_short_data




try out different simhash lengths
try out different tokenization schemes (like kgrams)





SimHashTfIdf
	In terms of performance ... still need to do the entire tfidf of the document set 
	benefit of including idf without the memory cost of saving the different vectors (only a bit string)
	SIMHASH is also not conducive for a rolling function
