# Perceptual Hashing

This repository contains code relating to perceptual hashes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing). Regular hashes are bit sensitive such that small changes to the data lead to a drastically different hash. For perceptual hashes, small changes in the data lead to small changes in the hash. 

I plan to investigate how perceptual hashes can be used with text data. Possible applications of text based perceptual hashes include measuring document similarity, query searching, plagiarism detection, and phishing website detection.
